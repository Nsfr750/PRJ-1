## Security Scope

### In Scope

The following security considerations are in scope for PRJ-1:

- **Code Execution**: Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- **File System**: Unauthorized file access or modification
- **Data Exposure**: Exposure of sensitive user data or project information
- **Authentication**: Bypass of authentication mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- **Configuration**: Security misconfigurations

### Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope:

- **Denial of Service**: Attacks that only affect availability
- **Physical Security**: Physical access to user systems
- **Social Engineering**: User manipulation or phishing
- **Environment Issues**: Security issues in user's environment (OS, Python, etc.)
- **Self-Inflicted Issues**: Security issues caused by user modifications

## Security Features

### üîê Built-in Security Measures

PRJ-1 includes several security features:

#### 1. Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Path traversal protection for file operations
- Input length limits to prevent buffer overflows

#### 2. File System Security

- Restricted file access to user-specified directories
- No automatic execution of external files
- Safe file handling with proper error checking

#### 3. Network Security

- Secure HTTP requests with proper certificate validation
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Secure data transmission practices

#### 4. Dependency Management

- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Vulnerability scanning for third-party packages
- Minimal dependency footprint

#### 5. Code Security

- No dynamic code execution
- Safe use of eval/exec (avoided where possible)
- Proper exception handling to prevent information leakage

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Download from Official Sources**: Only download PRJ-1 from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nsfr750/PRJ-1)
2. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version to ensure security patches
3. **Verify Signatures**: When available, verify file signatures before installation
4. **Run with Appropriate Permissions**: Don't run with administrator privileges unless necessary
5. **Review Dependencies**: Keep Python dependencies updated and secure

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates and security scanning
3. **Security Testing**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation**: Security features and considerations documented
5. **Incident Response**: Clear procedures for handling security incidents

## Dependency Security

### Current Dependencies

PRJ-1 uses the following main dependencies with their security considerations:

| Dependency | Version | Security Notes |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| PySide6    | >=6.5.0 | Qt framework for GUI - regularly updated |
| requests   | >=2.28.0 | HTTP library - secure by default |
| packaging  | >=21.0  | Version parsing - minimal attack surface |
| qrcode     | >=7.3.0 | QR code generation - safe for use |
| Wand       | >=0.6.0 | Image processing - validates input |

### Security Updates

Dependencies are monitored for security vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning**: Regular security scans using tools like `safety`
- **Update Policy**: Critical security updates applied within 7 days
- **Testing**: All dependency updates tested for compatibility
- **Communication**: Security updates communicated through release notes

## Data Protection

### User Data

PRJ-1 handles the following types of data:

- **Project Information**: Names, paths, and metadata of user projects
- **Configuration Data**: User preferences and settings
- **Log Files**: Application logs for debugging (may contain sensitive information)

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on user's system
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is sent to external servers without explicit user consent
- **Encryption**: Sensitive configuration data encrypted when possible
- **Log Management**: Logs are rotated and cleaned up automatically

### Data Retention

- **Configuration**: Retained until user deletes or resets
- **Logs**: Retained for 30 days, then automatically cleaned
- **Cache**: Temporary files cleaned on application exit
- **User Data**: Never collected or transmitted without consent

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Security vulnerability identified
2. **Assessment**: Impact and severity evaluated
3. **Containment**: Immediate measures to limit impact
4. **Resolution**: Fix developed and tested
